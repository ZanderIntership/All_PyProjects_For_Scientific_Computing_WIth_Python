📘 Merge Sort in Python

This project shows how the Merge Sort algorithm works.
Merge Sort is a divide ➗ and conquer 🏆 algorithm used to sort lists efficiently.

🛠️ How It Works

1️⃣ The list is split into two halves.
2️⃣ Each half is sorted on its own.
3️⃣ The halves are merged back together in the right order.

📊 Example

Start with an unsorted list ➡️ [4, 10, 6, 14, 2, 1, 8, 5]

After sorting ➡️ [1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, 14]

⚡ Efficiency

Time Complexity ⏱️: O(n log n) (best, average, and worst case)

Space Complexity 💾: O(n) (extra memory needed for merging)

▶️ How to Run

Save the script as merge_sort.py

Run it with Python 🐍

You’ll see the list before and after sorting

🎯 Why Use Merge Sort?

✅ Always runs in O(n log n) time
✅ Stable sorting (keeps equal elements in order)
✅ Works well with large datasets
