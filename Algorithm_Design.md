Shortest Path Finder 🛤️

This project is a Python implementation of Dijkstra’s algorithm for finding the shortest paths in a weighted graph.

It can compute:

The shortest path from a start node to all other nodes.

The shortest path from a start node to a specific target node.

Features ✨

Works with weighted graphs represented as adjacency lists.

Computes:

Shortest distances from a starting node.

Full path sequence for each node.

Can print:

Shortest paths to all nodes.

Or only to a specific target node.

Graph Representation 📊

The graph is represented as a Python dictionary, where:

Keys are node labels (e.g., "A", "B", "C").

Values are lists of tuples (neighbor, weight).
