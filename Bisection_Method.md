📐 Square Root Finder (Bisection Method)

✨ This project provides a simple implementation of the bisection method to approximate the square root of a number.

🧩 Features

✅ Handles positive numbers

✅ Special cases for 0 and 1

✅ Adjustable tolerance and maximum iterations

✅ Error raised for negative numbers 🚫

✅ Approximates the square root with step-by-step refinement

⚡ How It Works

🔹 The bisection method repeatedly halves an interval until it zeroes in on the square root of the target number.

Start with a range [0, max(1, target)]

Pick the midpoint ➗

Square it and compare with the target 🎯

Narrow down the interval until the difference is smaller than tolerance

Return the root approximation 💡
