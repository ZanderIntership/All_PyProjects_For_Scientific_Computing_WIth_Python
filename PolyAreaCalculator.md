ðŸŸ¦ Rectangle & Square Geometry Classes

A simple, object-oriented Python module for working with rectangles and squares, providing essential geometric operations such as area, perimeter, diagonal calculation, ASCII visualization, and shape fitting.

ðŸ“˜ Overview

This module defines two classes:

Rectangle â€” a general-purpose rectangle class.

Square â€” a specialized subclass of Rectangle that ensures equal sides.

Both classes provide intuitive methods for geometry operations and a clean, human-readable string representation.

ðŸ§± Class: Rectangle
Initialization
rect = Rectangle(width, height)
