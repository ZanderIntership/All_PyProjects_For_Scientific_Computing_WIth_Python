This project simulates random draws from a hat to estimate probabilities using the Monte Carlo method.
It is inspired by probability experiments where colored balls are drawn without replacement, and we estimate how likely certain outcomes are.

ðŸ“˜ Project Description

Suppose there is a hat containing:

5 blue balls

4 red balls

2 green balls

We want to find the probability that a random draw of 4 balls will contain at least 1 red ball and 2 green balls.

Instead of using complex mathematical formulas, this project estimates the probability by performing a large number of random experiments.

ðŸ§© Features

Simulate random draws without replacement.

Estimate probabilities using repeated experiments.

Works for any number and color of balls.

Modular design with a Hat class and an experiment function.
