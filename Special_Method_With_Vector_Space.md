📐 Vector Classes in Python

This project defines 2D and 3D vector classes in Python with rich operator overloading for mathematical operations.

✨ Supports both R2Vector (2D vectors) and R3Vector (3D vectors with cross product).

🔧 Features

➕ Addition (v1 + v2)

➖ Subtraction (v1 - v2)

✖️ Multiplication

Scalar multiplication (v * 3)

Dot product (v1 * v2)

❌ Cross product (only for R3Vector)

📏 Norm (magnitude) via .norm()

⚖️ Comparison operators (==, !=, <, >, <=, >=)

🖊️ Friendly __str__ & __repr__ for clean printing

🧩 Classes
🔹 R2Vector(x, y)
